Users
    - `TODO` I don't need a dbm, if each model is able to manage its own information in the database, my user behavior management will be much better.

Variables:

Pipelines:
    - `TODO` Testing the performance of custom jinja filters

Messages:
    - `TODO` Knowing when a message should wait and when to continue the flow

Actions:
    - `TODO` To be able to have an actions module that executes custom code, this is related to the other modules (Messages, Pipelines).
